Learning responsiveness

##Here are some of the most common practices to follow when building a responsive web page:

- Use relative units (such as percentages) for the sizes of the elements and fonts.
- Use CSS media queries to define breakpoints and layout changes.
- Define the viewport to adapt to mobile screens.
- Use CSS Flexbox to make it easier to create flexible layouts.
